## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Completion time tracking: play clock accumulates active time per game, pauses in the background and freezes on victory; terminal-style `T+MM:SS` timer in the game header (toggleable via the game menu), duration shown on victory, in archive rows, and in personal bests (#4)

- `SudoSodokuTests` unit test target covering puzzle generation (solvability, unique solution, difficulty scoring), ELO rating (K-factor tiers, anti-smurfing), and storage (persistence roundtrip, legacy save migration)
- Shared `SudoSodoku` scheme with test action, enabling `xcodebuild test` and Xcode Cloud test workflows

### Changed

- Set minimum deployment target to iOS 17.0 (aligned project and target settings)
- iPhone-only app: removed iPad-specific views, routing, and orientation settings
- Updated documentation to reflect local-only persistence (no iCloud sync)
- Aligned Game Center leaderboard IDs with bundle prefix (`dev.kaichen.sudoku.app.leaderboard.*`)
- Moved `ContentView` into `Views/` and extracted shared utilities (`AppConstants`, `DateFormatting`, `RankTier`, `LogicalEfficiencyStyle`)
- Centralized rank tiers, date formatting, and efficiency colors; removed duplicate logic across views
- `StatisticsManager` now auto-refreshes when storage changes
- `StorageManager` uses atomic JSON writes; `SudokuGame` preserves session `startTime` across saves
- Game Center auth runs once at app root; removed duplicate `authenticateUser()` calls
- Rating anti-smurfing: zero gain when puzzle difficulty is far below player ELO
- Unified signing config, Swift 5.9, marketing version `1.0.0`, and `play.sh` bundle ID fallback
- Landing page version reads from app bundle instead of hardcoded string
- Fixed swapped section bodies in DEVELOPER.md (Achievement System / iPad Support) and aligned the roadmap tiers with the phased v1.1-v1.3 plan

### Removed

- `Views-iPad/` directory and `ViewRouter` platform routing
- Dead Game Center UI helpers, unused haptic methods, and unused statistics trend code
- Duplicate `run.sh` script (use `play.sh` as the canonical simulator runner)
- Committed build artifacts (`SudoSodoku.xcarchive/`, `IPA/`) from version control

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-02

### 🎉 First Official Release

SudoSodoku v1.0.0 marks a major milestone - the first stable release of our terminal-style Sudoku experience. After months of development and beta testing, we're excited to share this polished, feature-complete game with the community.

**System Requirements (at release):**

- iOS 17.0 or later
- Minimal storage (~5MB)
- Optional internet (for Game Center)

**What's Next:**
See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md) for the current roadmap.
