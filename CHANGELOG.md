## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Swiping back right after picking a tab-completion option no longer strands the screen: composer reset now keys off the navigation binding (which always clears on pop) instead of `onAppear` (which never fires when the pop lands mid-push-transition), so the landing and mode-selection screens can't come back with a stale command and every option dead (#79)
- An overlong composed command no longer shoves the layout around: the terminal command line reserves a two-line slot up front, so wrapping happens inside it and the hero, tagline, and completion menu stay put on the landing and mode-selection screens (#78)
- Stats no longer judge solves by undo count anywhere: personal best rows drop UNDOS/QUALITY for date set and rating gain, recent completions show the solve time instead of the undo-derived EFF score, and the legacy personal-best fallback (pre-time-tracking records) picks the most recent solve instead of the fewest undos; the dead `logicalEfficiency`/`logicalQuality` metrics are removed (#77)
- The landing hero's glow pulse survives navigation: it restarts on every return to the landing screen instead of freezing dim after the first push; steady full glow under Reduce Motion (#68)
- Game Center sign-in no longer jolts the landing screen: the identity row renders every auth state in a fixed 30×30 avatar slot with a constant row height, so authentication swaps pixels in place instead of re-flowing the layout (#66)
- Command-line caret stays solid under Reduce Motion instead of blinking; `DateFormatting.playClock` is now `nonisolated`, silencing the main-actor warning in StatsView (#64)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-08

### 🚀 sudo solve — root access for logical purists

v2.0.0 is the release where SudoSodoku becomes what it always wanted to be: a full terminal fantasy with a real competitive ladder. Game Center leaderboards and achievements go live, every puzzle now reads as hand-crafted, and the whole game got a feel pass — haptics, signature moments, and accessibility discipline throughout.

**Requirements:** iOS 17.0+, iPhone only. Internet optional (Game Center).

### Added

- The landing terminal boots in on launch: `sudo sudosodoku` types itself into the prompt and the tab-completion menu materializes once the command lands — once per process, so back-navigations get the materialized prompt; silent (no keystroke haptics) and instant under Reduce Motion (#54)
- Completion time tracking: play clock accumulates active time per game, pauses in the background and freezes on victory; terminal-style `T+MM:SS` timer in the game header (toggleable via the game menu), duration shown on victory, in archive rows, and in personal bests (#4)
- Auto-clear pencil notes: placing a number removes that digit from notes in the same row, column, and box; undo/redo treats the placement and cleared notes as one compound move (#5)
- Numpad digit keys dim and strike through once all nine instances of a digit are placed; undo/clear revives them (#6)
- Numpad dims when no cell is selected and taps give a warning haptic nudge instead of being silently swallowed (#7)
- Semantic haptic vocabulary: selection tick on cell changes (`.sensoryFeedback`), rigid impact on placement, soft impact on removal/notes, error notification on conflicts, and a custom CoreHaptics victory pattern (three ascending ticks + rumble) with graceful fallback (#8)
- Conflicting placements shake the cell with a short CRT-glitch jitter alongside the error haptic; disabled under Reduce Motion (#9)
- The selection frame is now a single shared rectangle that glides between cells with a spring instead of jumping; instant under Reduce Motion (#10)
- Game Center leaderboards: global ELO ranking plus per-difficulty fastest-time boards; victories submit the solve time (whole seconds) and rating gains submit the new ELO; terminal-styled leaderboard screen (`cat /leaderboard` in the profile) with guest sign-in notice and `GKAccessPoint` fallback (#11)
- Difficulty selection is a live command line: `root@ios:~$ sudo breach ` awaits its flag over a tab-completion menu; picking a flag types it into the command (with per-keystroke haptics), the command executes, and the breach begins — flowing straight into the loading log that opens with the same command; instant under Reduce Motion (#47)
- Breach-log loading screen: puzzle generation now plays a typewriter terminal log (`$ sudo breach --target=grid_9x9`) whose verdict lines report the real uniqueness check and difficulty index; instant under Reduce Motion (#12)
- Victory sequence rework: real matrix rain (TimelineView + Canvas), typewriter `ACCESS GRANTED`, ELO ticker rolling to the new value with a rank-up ceremony on tier crossings; dismissed by tap instead of a 2-second timer; fade-only under Reduce Motion (#13)
- Achievement system: eleven binary unlocks (first solve, solve counts, first MASTER, sub-3-minute solve, rank tiers, one secret) evaluated on victory, persisted locally, reported to Game Center with an offline queue; terminal toast on unlock and an achievement wall in the profile (#14; a zero-undo unlock was cut pre-release — undo count never measured cleanliness, #62)
- The sudoers joke: the first MASTER game opens with "<user> is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported." before the punchline grants root access — once ever, tap to skip, and it unlocks the secret INCIDENT_REPORTED achievement (#15)
- Phosphor pulse: completing a row, column, or box flashes a brief green glow over the unit with a medium haptic; one haptic per move with victory > unit > placement priority (#16)
- Streak indicator: five or more consecutive conflict-free placements show `streak: N ▲` in the game header; a conflict resets it silently (#17)
- `SudoSodokuTests` unit test target covering puzzle generation (solvability, unique solution, difficulty scoring), ELO rating (K-factor tiers, anti-smurfing), and storage (persistence roundtrip, legacy save migration)
- Shared `SudoSodoku` scheme with test action, enabling `xcodebuild test` and Xcode Cloud test workflows
- Product identity: slogan "sudo solve — root access for logical purists", four-pillar philosophy in the README, and the tagline on the landing screen
- Debug builds only: `$ rm -rf /user_data` factory reset in the profile (records, rating, achievements, sudoers-joke flag, and Game Center achievement progress via `resetAchievements`) for verifying first-run flows; compiled out of Release

### Changed

- Every screen entered from the landing page now reads as one continuous, accumulating shell command instead of separate button taps: picking `breach`, `archives`, `stats`, or `whoami` types the subcommand into the prompt before navigating, and the destination screen echoes the full command (e.g. `sudo sudosodoku breach --easy`) it was reached with (#47)
- Mode selection's tab-completion menu is pushed further down the screen instead of sitting directly under the prompt (#47)
- Command-line branding renamed from `sudo sodoku` to `sudo sudosodoku` everywhere the literal command appears: the landing hero title, the composer's base command, and every echoed command header (#51)
- Statistics tell the truth for a no-fail game: WIN_RATE is gone (boards are only finished or unfinished — abandoning isn't losing), BEST_EFF is demoted from the headline (it contradicted the fearless-undo philosophy); SYSTEM_OVERVIEW now shows SOLVED / ELO / FASTEST / HARDEST, and a personal best is the fastest solve (efficiency stays as per-record detail) (#46)
- Puzzles now read as hand-crafted: each board picks an aesthetic clue-pattern style at random (180° rotational, horizontal/vertical mirror, diagonal, anti-diagonal, or deliberately free — hand-made collections vary, symmetry is common but not universal), and every difficulty has a technique identity enforced at generation — EASY solves with singles and always offers parallel moves, MEDIUM never demands more than locked candidates / naked pairs, HARD is designed around a required intermediate "aha" (and never needs more — no guessing), MASTER resists intermediate techniques entirely (#39)
- Leaderboard submissions previously sent the puzzle difficulty index (0-100), which ranked players by generation luck; scores are now actual performance — solve time per difficulty, ELO on the global board (#11)
- Set minimum deployment target to iOS 17.0 (aligned project and target settings)
- iPhone-only app: removed iPad-specific views, routing, and orientation settings
- Updated documentation to reflect local-only persistence (no iCloud sync)
- Aligned Game Center leaderboard IDs with bundle prefix (`dev.kaichen.sudoku.app.leaderboard.*`)
- Moved `ContentView` into `Views/` and extracted shared utilities (`AppConstants`, `DateFormatting`, `RankTier`, `LogicalEfficiencyStyle`)
- Centralized rank tiers, date formatting, and efficiency colors; removed duplicate logic across views
- `StatisticsManager` now auto-refreshes when storage changes
- `StorageManager` uses atomic JSON writes; `SudokuGame` preserves session `startTime` across saves
- Game Center auth runs once at app root; removed duplicate `authenticateUser()` calls
- Rating anti-smurfing: zero gain when puzzle difficulty is far below player ELO
- Unified signing config, Swift 5.9, marketing version `1.0.0`, and `play.sh` bundle ID fallback
- Landing page version reads from app bundle instead of hardcoded string
- Fixed swapped section bodies in DEVELOPER.md (Achievement System / iPad Support) and aligned the roadmap tiers with the phased v1.1-v1.3 plan

### Fixed

- Overlong terminal commands (e.g. `sudo sudosodoku breach --easy`) shattered into stacked fragments: the prompt was an HStack of separate Texts, so each segment wrapped inside its own bounds and got centered against the others. The command line is now one concatenated Text that wraps as a single continuous flow, like a real shell; the caret blinks hard on/off instead of fading (#60)
- Solved records are now immutable history: restarting a solved puzzle from the archive (`sudo reboot`) or the in-game RETRY forked in place under the same record id, so the first autosave overwrote the completed run — the solve silently vanished from SOLVED counts, personal bests, and recent completions while the ELO it granted remained. Both paths now fork a fresh record; the original solve stays (#56)
- Viewing a solved record (`cat solution`) re-saved it with a fresh `lastPlayedTime`, so merely looking at an old solve bumped it to today and reshuffled the archive order. Viewing is read-only now (#56)
- First launch after install stared at a pale white screen until the first frame arrived: the auto-generated launch screen uses `systemBackground` (white in light mode) while the app itself is always dark. The launch screen now boots in the terminal background color, and the Game Center handshake waits a beat past the first frame so GameKit's first-run spin-up doesn't compete with the initial render
- The secret INCIDENT_REPORTED achievement wasn't actually secret: the profile wall listed its title with only the description masked. Hidden achievements are now entirely absent from the wall until earned, matching Game Center's Hidden semantics
- Profile (WHOAMI) statistics desynced from storage: `@Published` emits on willSet, and the stats refresh read the records back through the singleton — always one mutation behind. Zeros stuck on a fresh launch, numbers survived the debug wipe, and only playing a move "fixed" them. Stats now derive from the emitted value (#41)
- Achievement unlocks had no visible feedback: the toast raced the victory overlay and could expire unseen behind the matrix rain. Unlocks now render inside the victory sequence itself (`>> UNLOCKED: ...` under the ELO ticker), and the sudoers interstitial types out its own secret-achievement line — the separate toast and its cross-view choreography are gone
- Pinned `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` back to the literal `17.0` on all targets: Xcode's "Update to recommended settings" had rewritten it to `$(RECOMMENDED_IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET)`, which Xcode Cloud's toolchain resolves to nothing, dropping the deployment target to the SDK floor and failing builds with iOS 16/17 availability errors

### Removed

- `Views-iPad/` directory and `ViewRouter` platform routing
- Dead Game Center UI helpers, unused haptic methods, and unused statistics trend code
- Duplicate `run.sh` script (use `play.sh` as the canonical simulator runner)
- Committed build artifacts (`SudoSodoku.xcarchive/`, `IPA/`) from version control
